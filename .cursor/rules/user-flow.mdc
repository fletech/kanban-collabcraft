# ***Primary user-flow:*** 

#  **Basic User Flow for MVP**

## **Start and Access**

1. **Accessing the platform**: The user enters the application and sees the start screen.  
2. **Login**: The user identifies themselves using their Gmail account, seeing their profile (for example: Alexandra C.) in the top right corner once authenticated. If not an existing user, registration upon clicking in SIGN UP button (this option is provided by Gmail integration)

## **Main Navigation**

3. **Project selection**: In the left sidebar, the user can select between different projects, that the user has created, in case there is none, show a button to create a new project.

## **Project Dashboard**

4. **Board overview**:   
   As Dashboard, will be a brief of projects (cards) in case there is no project created yet, a button to create one. Once there are one or more projects the user can pick one to see then a board organized into four status columns:  
   * New  
   * In progress  
   * Review  
   * Done  
5. **Progress tracking**: At the top, the user visualizes a progress bar indicating that the project is completed to the corresponding percentage of their completed tasks over the total. If there are none, it shows nothing.

## **Task Management**

6. **Task visualization**: The user can see task cards distributed in the columns according to their status, each with:  
   * Task title  
   * Brief description  
   * Priority label (Must, Medium, Tiny, Huge) \-\> enum  
7. **Task creation**: The user can create new tasks by clicking on the "+ Add Task" buttons available in each column.  
   This task can be dragged among columns and therefore updating their status according to the column itâ€™s been dragged to.  
8. **Board management**: The user can:  
   * Filter the view using the tabs: Description, Board, Notes, and Test  
   * Add a new board with the "+ Add board" button  
   * Update the view with the circular refresh button

## **Task Interaction**

9. **Task details**: The user can view detailed information for each task, examples:  
   * For "AST Builder": "Create an Abstract Syntax Tree using tokens and TreeSitter"  
   * For "JavaScript lexer": "Research JavaScript grammar and provide an overview on what to..."  
10. **Task categorization**: The user identifies the priority of each task through color labels that come from the "tasks\_priority" enum in the DB:  
    * Must (red)  
    * Medium (blue)  
    * Tiny (light green)  
    * Huge (orange)

## **Collaboration**

11. **Teamwork**: The user can see avatars of other collaborators at the top of the board, showing who is working on the project.

This flow focuses exclusively on the functionalities visible in the screenshot, providing an experience centered on task and project management through a Kanban board system with clearly defined states.

***Secondary user-flow-*** not implemented at first, but the DB supports it.  

**Project Member Management**

## **Accessing Member Management**

1. **Member panel access**: While viewing a project dashboard, the user can click on a "Members" or "Team" icon in the sidebar  
2. **Member overview**: Upon accessing the member section, the user sees a list of current project members with their:  
   * Profile picture  
   * Full name  
   * Email  
   * Role (owner, admin, member, viewer)  
   * Join date

## **Adding New Members**

3. **Invitation interface**: Users with owner or admin roles see an "+ Invite Member" button prominently displayed in the members section.  
4. **Member invitation flow**:  
   * Clicking the invite button opens a modal dialog  
   * The modal contains a form with:  
     * Email input field  
     * Role selection dropdown (admin, member, viewer)  
     * Optional personal message field  
     * "Send Invitation" and "Cancel" buttons  
5. **Invitation confirmation**: After submitting, the user sees a success confirmation and the invited email appears in a "Pending Invitations" section with status "Invited".

6. **Role management**: Owners and admins can change roles of existing members by:  
   * Clicking on a three-dot menu next to each member  
   * Selecting "Change Role" from the dropdown  
   * Choosing a new role from the role selector  
7. **Member removal**: Owners and admins can remove members by:  
   * Clicking on the three-dot menu next to a member  
   * Selecting "Remove from Project"  
   * Confirming the action in a confirmation dialog

## **Visual Design Elements**

9. **Member cards**: Each member is displayed in a card with:  
   * Left-aligned avatar  
   * Name and email details in the center  
   * Role indicator using subtle color coding (Owner: gold, Admin: blue, Member: green, Viewer: gray)  
   * Action menu on the right
