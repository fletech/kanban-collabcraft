AI Document Integration for TaskFlow
11. Feature Extension: AI Document Analysis
11.1 General Description
TaskFlow will be enhanced with AI-powered document analysis capabilities, allowing users to upload documents related to their projects, analyze them using artificial intelligence, and automatically generate tasks based on the AI's findings. This feature aims to streamline project planning by extracting actionable items directly from project documentation.

11.2 Scope vs. Out of Scope
In Scope:
Document upload and management within projects
AI analysis of documents to extract insights and potential tasks
Conversion of AI suggestions into tasks on the Kanban board
Basic tracking of document usage and AI interactions
Support for common document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
Out of Scope:
Advanced document editing within the platform
OCR for handwritten documents or images
Real-time collaborative document editing
Advanced document version control
Document template creation
11.3 User Flow
The user flow is divided into two distinct stages that align with the implementation phases:

Phase 1: Document Management Flow
Document Upload and Storage:
User navigates to their profile and accesses the "My Documents" section
User uploads a document through drag-and-drop or file browser
System displays upload progress and confirms successful storage
Document appears in the user's document library with metadata
Document Organization:
User can create folders to organize documents
User can view, download, rename, or delete documents
User can search and filter their document library
Basic document preview is available for supported file types
Phase 2: AI Chat and Task Generation Flow
Document-AI Interaction:
User selects a document from their library and opens the AI chat interface
The chat interface indicates the document is loaded as context
User can ask questions about the document or request task suggestions
AI responds in a conversational format within the chat interface
Task Creation from Chat:
AI suggests potential tasks based on document content within the chat
User reviews suggestions directly in the chat interface
User can click on suggestions to create tasks with pre-filled details
System confirms task creation and provides links to view tasks
User can continue the conversation to refine or generate more tasks
Document-Task Relationship:
Created tasks maintain a reference to the source document
User can see which tasks were generated from specific documents
Tasks include a badge or indicator showing they were AI-generated
11.4 Key Features
Features are organized according to the two primary implementation phases:

Phase 1: Document Management Features
Document Upload and Storage:
Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, etc.)
Secure storage in Supabase with proper access controls
Progress indicators for uploads
File size and type validation
Document Organization:
Personal document library within user profile
Folder creation and management
Sorting options (by name, date, size, type)
Document tagging capabilities
Document Interaction:
Basic preview for supported document types
Download functionality
Rename and delete options
Document sharing with project members (optional)
Search and Discovery:
Full-text search within document library
Filter by file type, upload date, and size
Recently accessed documents view
Favorite documents functionality
Phase 2: AI Chat and Task Generation Features
AI Chat Interface:
Document-context aware conversation
Dedicated chat UI for document interaction
Chat history preservation
Message threading for organized conversations
Document Analysis:
Text extraction and processing capabilities
Intelligent parsing of document structure
Key point identification
Summary generation on request
Task Suggestion:
In-chat task recommendations based on document content
Confidence indicators for suggestions
Context preservation from document to suggestion
Multiple suggestion formats (bullet points, conversation)
Task Creation:
One-click conversion from suggestions to tasks
Pre-filled task details based on context
Task priority and effort recommendations
Automatic project and status assignment
Source tracking back to originating document and conversation
11.5 Technology Stack Extensions
Storage:
Supabase Storage for document files
AI Integration:
Vercel AI SDK for AI provider management
Integration with models like DeepSeek for document analysis
Document processing pipeline
11.6 Data Model Extensions
Based on the existing database structure, the following additions will be made:

Documents Table
UUID as primary key
Name (required)
File path in storage
File type
File size
Project ID (reference to projects table)
Uploaded by (reference to users table)
Created and updated timestamps
Document Analysis Table
UUID as primary key
Document ID (reference to documents table)
Analysis status
Analysis timestamp
AI provider used
Analysis summary
Raw AI response (JSON)
Task Sources Table
UUID as primary key
Task ID (reference to tasks table)
Source type (enum: 'ai_suggestion', 'manual', 'template')
Document ID (reference to documents table, nullable)
Source details (JSON)
Created timestamp
11.7 Implementation Plan
The implementation will be clearly divided into two distinct phases:

Phase 1: Document Management UI and Storage
This phase focuses on the core document management functionality without AI integration:

Implement document upload interface with drag-and-drop capability
Set up Supabase Storage integration for secure document storage
Create document listing and management UI within user profile
Develop document metadata display (type, size, upload date)
Implement document preview capabilities for common formats
Add document organization features (folders, tags)
Create user profile document library view
Implement basic search and filter functionality
Ensure document access controls based on user permissions
Completion of Phase 1 will deliver a fully functional document management system integrated within TaskFlow, providing value to users even before AI capabilities are added.

Phase 2: AI Chat Interface and Task Generation
This phase introduces the AI capabilities through a chat interface:

Create a dedicated AI chat interface within the document view
Set up Vercel AI SDK integration with selected providers
Implement document-context awareness in the chat system
Develop AI document analysis functionality
Create task suggestion display within chat interface
Implement one-click task creation from AI suggestions
Add task attribute recommendations (priority, effort estimation)
Develop document-task relationship tracking
Create suggestion confidence indicators
Implement user feedback mechanisms for AI suggestions
Phase 2 completion will transform the document management system into an AI-powered productivity tool that can intelligently extract tasks from documents and help users organize their work more efficiently.

11.8 Additional Considerations
Performance
Implement document size limitations (initial limit: 10MB per file)
Optimize AI processing for larger documents
Consider background processing for lengthy analysis operations
Security
Ensure document access respects project member permissions
Implement virus scanning for uploaded documents
Store AI analysis results securely
Privacy
Clear user consent for AI processing of documents
Options to delete documents and related AI analysis
Transparency about AI providers used and data handling
11.9 Success Metrics
Percentage of projects using document analysis features
Average number of tasks generated from AI suggestions
User satisfaction with AI-suggested tasks (accuracy, relevance)
Time saved in project planning through AI-assisted task creation
Document analysis feature adoption rate
